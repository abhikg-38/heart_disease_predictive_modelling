# heart_disease_predictive_modelling
Exploratory data analysis includes grouping the dataset by attributes like 'diagnosis','sex' and 'age'. Diagnosis can be either 0,1,2,3,4 indicating severity of heart disease. Metrics like histograms are then plotted for each individual group to see how exactly the symptoms vary across the spectrum. The groups having non numeric attributes are appropriately handled and some of the attributes are scaled using StandardScaler to better improve model performance. Correlation matrix is visualized to see which attributes have greater sway over final diagnosis.

Algorithms like SGDClassifier, SVC and RnadomForestClassifier are used to handle this multi class classification problem. GridSearchCV is used to single out optimal hyperparameters. Evaluation metrics such as precision score, recall score and f1 score is used to test correctness of predictions. Confusion matrices are employed as well. Techniques like over sampling are also used to make up for class imbalance. In addition to this, these very metrics coupled with ROC curve are calculated for every individual class to see if the model possesses the same degree of accuracy and robustness for each class. The class labels are binarized for this purpose. These metrics help us compare the algorithms against each other.
